# hello-world
This is my, Niche Baska's first repository created on GitHub.

I am currently a high school student in grade 11, and I am trying to learn something about coding on GitHub.

A couple of years ago, I have started learning programming with HTML, CSS (IDK if they are called programming languages) and JavaScript. I have also made several webpages, with very simple structures and contents. Right now, I am a little bit confused about my studying of programming. I actually don't realise what I want to do or can do with what I learned. So I am just exploring. Hopefully, I am going to be majored in computer science as I go to university, and I want to become a software engineer after I graduate. 

That's it.
